FRONTEND - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND

- We need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices
- Using this middle end, when client sends request we will be able to make a decision that which microservice should actually respond to this request.
- We can do message validation, message transformation, rate limiting.
- We try to prepare an API Gateway that acts as this middle end.
